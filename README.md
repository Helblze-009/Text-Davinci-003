Text-davinci-003 Chatbot Application
This is a simple chatbot application that uses the OpenAI text-davinci-003 language model to generate responses to user prompts. The application is built with Vanilla JS and Node.js, using the Vite build tool and the Express web framework.

After installing Node.js, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

bash

cd text-davinci-003-chatbot
npm install
Usage
To start the application, run the following command:

bash

npm run dev
This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

To build the application for production, run the following command:

bash

npm run server
This will generate a production-ready build in the dist directory.

Configuration
The application requires an OpenAI API key to access the text-davinci-003 model. To configure the API key, create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and add the following line:
